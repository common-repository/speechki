*“We’ve been using SpeechKit to convert our articles into audio for over a year. Overall, we are very impressed with the service. The quality of the audio is consistently the best we’ve found available, the plugin and dashboard provides all the functionality we need, processing and delivery of the audio is fast and the players fit nicely on our page. We’ve had great customer feedback and the team have been quick to make adjustments based on our suggestions” - Kenneth Creamer, Creamer Media.*

== Highest Quality Audio ==

By serving millions of audio articles SpeechKit has developed the highest quality text to speech available to digital publishers. Our Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) processing engine cleans text of unwanted elements, identifies and handles problematic words and adds human-like intonation, punctuation, tone and much more.

== Podcast and Smart Speaker Distribution ==

Expand the reach of your stories in seconds by adding additional distribution to podcast apps and smart speakers (premium). Manage feeds to podcast platforms (Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Play), smart speakers (Amazon Alexa, Google Home) or set up an audio RSS feed to push to your own integrations. Each SpeechKit project can be assigned any number of distribution channels and can be managed in the dashboard tool.

== AdStudio ==

Audio articles provide a brand new way to reach your audience. Monetize this additional content with SpeechKit’s AdStudio. Premium users can create campaigns from the dashboard, upload their own audio track or create a text to speech messages and deliver this as pre-roll to their audio articles. Campaign success is tracked against impressions, CPMs (cost-per-thousand) and CPCs (cost-per-click) and can be paused or managed at any time. Larger audiences may also qualify for programmatic sponsorship through one of SpeechKit’s advertising partners.

== Real-Time Analytics ==

Track, analyse and optimize your audio strategy with granular audio analytics. This premium feature provides paid customers with metrics including listens, audio completion rates, audio click through, audio retention and device type. Performance may be broken down per article for trend analysis, distribution optimization and commercial decision making. Analytics can be accessed in the SpeechKit dashboard and are available with all paid plans.

== Premium Product ==

Access to SpeechKit is free for 5 stories per month. Upgrade to a paid plan in the dashboard for more audio versions and access to premium features, including Real-Time Analytics, Programmatic Ad Placement, Smart Speaker Integration and our Audio API.
